In this problem we shall count the number of hats the last person can see and depending on number of hats he will say White if white hats are odd or else black. The next prisoner will count the white or black hats(depending on what the first person said) and if the count is even it means he has the same color hat else it is the opposite color hat. All other prisoner will keep making the count as odd or even depending on the previous prisoners answer and can predict their own hat color. In this except the last person everone will answer correctly. There's a 50% chance the last person will be shot.
